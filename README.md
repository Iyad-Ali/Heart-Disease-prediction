# Heart-Disease-prediction
machine learning model for predicting heart disease.
I made some explatory data analysis on the data then used 3 models and tested them (KNN, RandomForestClassifier, logisticRegression) after evaluating them,  logistic 
regression achieved the highest score.
Every point in the notebook is explained.
